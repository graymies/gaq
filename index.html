                        <p>Homeowners are signing up with solar panel installation companies that are fighting with each other just to install those panels. The installation could be free or low cost, your energy bills could be cut by 50% to 80% and you could even make money by selling the electricity back to your energy provider.

                                Subscription Enrollment: Purchasing from the Scanner Family shop (subscribe), not One-Time Orders shop, will enroll and activate your subscription. By proceeding to complete the checkout process you acknowledge and consent that you wish to contribute monthly to support the bimonthly charity campaigns. We reserve the right to change the subscription and our product prices without notice. To successfully unsubscribe, a member must complete the first cycle as subscriber, meaning one charge of $21.00 + shipping, prior to the system executing an unsubscribe request.
                            </p>

Your Monthly Subscription will automatically renew every month unless and until you cancel, or we terminate it, and Scanner will automatically bill the monthly Subscription fee to your Payment Method during the billing cycle (1st-10th of the month), as applicable. You must cancel your monthly subscription prior to the 15th of the renewal month before it automatically renews to avoid billing of the fee for the next campaign to your Payment Method. To cancel your monthly subscription, you must visit Scanner.Com and complete the unsubscribe form on the site. If you cancel, your monthly subscription will continue until the end of your then-current monthly subscription term.

                            </p>

                                When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.
                            </p>

                                Our store is hosted by CRM software. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you.

                                If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.

                            <p>

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.
                            </p>

                            <p>
